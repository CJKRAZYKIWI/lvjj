<h1>Welcome to my Las Vegas Jiu-Jitsu github repository!</h1>

Las Vegas Jiu-Jitsu (LVJJ) founder Cresencio Zamora created and built this team with his own time and money. Everything within the gym from the MIAL apparel, jiu-jitsu mats, to the disinfectants are all bought by Cresencio or donated by other students. 

I created this webpage for LVJJ due to Cresencio's constant selfless actions and his strong desire to help others better themselves. Cresencio is an advocate to help pressure law enforcement departments into implementing basic jiu-jitsu as mandatory defensive tactics. His students within his school are predominantly in law enforcement within the Las Vegas Valley.

As a former law enforcement officer, I wanted to support Cresencio due to his unselfishness and strong passion to help other's better themselves.

This webpage was created with React, React-Bootstrap, and deployed with AWS.
